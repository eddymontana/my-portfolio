Edidiong Aaron: AI/ML & Data Science Portfolio
About Me
Hello! I'm Eddy, a dedicated Data Scientist, AI/ML Engineer, and Prompt Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems. I specialize in turning complex data into actionable insights and creating powerful, user-friendly applications with technologies like Python, Flutter, and Google Cloud. As a continuous learner and Google Developer, I am always exploring new ways to solve real-world problems and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

Key Skills
Machine Learning & AI: Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, and Prompt Engineering

Programming Languages: Python, Dart (for Flutter)

Frameworks & Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Streamlit, and Flutter

Tools & Platforms: Git, GitHub, Hugging Face, make.com, and Google Cloud

Projects
1. End-to-End Chatbot
This project is a simple but complete end-to-end chatbot built to showcase the core principles of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The bot is trained to recognize a variety of user intents and provide relevant, predefined responses.

Key Features:

Intent Recognition: The chatbot uses a machine learning model to classify user queries.

Conversational Interface: The application features a clean, chat-like interface built with Streamlit.

Simple Deployment: The project is a standalone application that is easy to set up and run locally.

Technologies Used: Python, Streamlit, Hugging Face, and scikit-learn

2. Customer Churn Analysis
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using a machine learning model. The goal is to identify at-risk customers so the company can implement targeted retention strategies and improve customer lifetime value.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to understand customer behavior patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Development and evaluation of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Performance Evaluation: A thorough evaluation of model accuracy and effectiveness.

Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn

3. Loan Application Risk Assessment
This is an application designed to assess the risk of default for loan applicants. The project uses historical financial data to build a predictive model, helping financial institutions make more informed and responsible lending decisions.

Key Features:

Data Preparation: Cleaning and engineering features from raw data.

Risk Scoring Model: Development of a classification model for credit risk.

Interactive Interface: A simple web interface built with Streamlit to get a risk score for new applicants.

Technologies Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit

4. Multi-Label Image Classification
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for multi-label image classification. Unlike traditional models that predict a single category, this model can identify multiple objects or concepts within a single image, such as "cat," "dog," and "park" at the same time.

Key Features:

Transfer Learning: Utilizes a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG, ResNet) to accelerate training.

Web-Based Interface: A user-friendly web interface to upload images and view predicted labels.

Model Optimization: Fine-tuning the model to achieve high accuracy on a custom dataset.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and Flask
